      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This is a fan-made visualizer for the music of Deltarune.
        It's currently a work in progress.
      </p>
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p><b>Q: Why did you make this?</b></p>
      <p>I wanted a resource that compiled community knowledge in one spot, while being editable, looking nice, and trying to be as complete and accurate as possible.</p>
      <p><b>Q: How do you organize the connections?</b></p>
      <p>I try to stay consistent, prioritizing release order unless there's a thematic reason to do otherwise. Songs reference other songs through leitmotifs or otherwise, represented by edges. The <span style="color: rgb(255, 236, 68)">Freedom Motif</span> having its own node is an exception.</p>
      <p><b>Q: I noticed a mistake. / How can I contribute?</b></p>
      <p>You can contribute by commenting on the <a href="https://github.com/moxis-web/DRMV"><u>GitHub</u></a> or sending a message on Bluesky (coming soon). Thank you so much!</p>

      <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
      <p>This is a project to compile community knowledge, so I want to thank everyone who analyzed Deltarune's music and shared their findings.
        Here are some of the resources that helped me while making this.
